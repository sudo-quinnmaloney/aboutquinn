  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class = "intro" id = "home_intro">
    <p>Welcome to my website, which I'm building to use as a sort of journal for my friends, family, and future self; and as encouragement to develop basic web-development skills overtime.</p>
    <p>If you're a stranger, feel free to look around and maybe glean some entertainment or experience from getting to know me. If you're an employer it's probably a little too soon for this website to be impressive at all to you, but welcome nonetheless (please hire me).</p>
    <p><em>Quinn, why are you so extra? Why not just post to social media?<em> For one, it never hurts to develop new skills (e.g. web development). Second, sometimes the 'social' side of social media makes me anxious. I want to share my life and have memories to look back on, and I'm making it a one-way street. Transmission only.</p>
