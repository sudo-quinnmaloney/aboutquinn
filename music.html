      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>I'm not exactly a musical genius, but sharing my music is important to me. Each song is a snapshot of my life at the time, and when I'm gone I want those little peices of me to be there for my family and friends. Maybe one day Elon and friends can upload my consciousness to the cloud, but until then I'll talk about the meaning and the stories behind my music here. See all my music for yourself on <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/quinnmaloney" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;" >soundcloud</a>.</p>
      <p>You can also see what I like to listen to by following me on <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/user/quinnmaloney22?si=LpRefiyqQ-6Boy01c1wQNQ" onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;" >spotify</a>.</p>

      <p>A track from an ep in the works. I know it's rough, but when I make something I never have the patience to refine it or re-record much. I like to think that my music is more authentic for it. More shitty, granted, but definitely sincere. I'm aiming to appeal to those elite who, as comedian Tom Lehrer so lovingly put it, "equate athenticity with merit."</p>
      <p>Through sheer brute force, the refrain of Ed Sheeran's Perfect is, like a good number of Ed Sheeran's tracks, permanently ingrained into the heads of most living adults under 30. It was one of many songs I grew to like while Shan and I were dating, and one that I was reminiscing over.</p>
      <p>It makes me remember that Shan and I really did have that "perfect" romance that so many people pine for, that so many people fantasize about over songs like Perfect. Obviously any relationship has trials, but I loved her and she loved me and we made fantastic memories. She was beyond perfect. What come after something like that? What now? What lies beyond?</p>
      <p>It's been a few months now and I still love her a lot, still feel the way the song describes. Regardless, I decided to leave. While I was recording this track, the sadness and nostalgia evolved into a grim determination. Suddenly there was momentum in the song, representing my committment to change- to end this habit of self-sabotage.</p>

      <p>The past year has exposed some incredibly dark and morbidly fascinating parts of humanity. At a time when everything was fucked - when the leader of the free world lacked compassion, when the masses lacked understanding and the ability to reflect, when a pandemic stressed our economic and social infrastructures, as the diseases of planet and people continued to fester- it all felt a little overwhelming that night.</p>
      <p>It wasn't intentional, but the guitar style and tone reminds me of "Doomsday", by Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Whether a subliminal decision or not, I was just searching for a tone that described how I felt. Somber, pleading, a little resigned, and a little removed - as if through a veil.</p>
      <p>I decided to layer a recording of my mom saying something, but when I walked in the living room she was listening to this.</p>
